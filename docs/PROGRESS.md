# Hearthdelve — Progress

_Last updated: 2026-09-29_

## Status

- **Phase 1 (Combat Prototype):** done and playtested by you in the editor. Feel tuning is ongoing.
- **Phase 2 (Tavern Prototype):** implemented and passing automated verification. **Not yet playtested by a human.**

Tests: **182 project EditMode tests + 14 PlayMode tests, all passing, 0 compiler warnings.** The batch run reports one more EditMode test because the Addressables package adds a stub test.

### Phase 2 criteria

| Criterion | Where | Verified by |
|---|---|---|
| Debug action fills the storeroom with Phase 1 ingredients at mixed quality and freshness | `DebugStockFiller`, prep screen button, F4 | EditMode fill test; PlayMode prep test |
| Pick a menu of up to 3 dishes from 5 Biome 1 recipes before service | `TavernDirector.ToggleMenu`, `TavernPrepScreen`, `Data/Recipes` | EditMode menu-size test; PlayMode cap test |
| Grill, Tap and Serving work through `IMinigame` | `GrillMinigame`, `TapMinigame`, `ServingMinigame` (Core `IMinigame`) | 17 EditMode minigame tests, including "default tuning takes 5–10 s" |
| Villager, adventurer and dwarf enter, sit, order, wait (patience), eat, pay and leave, with flavor preferences affecting satisfaction | `CustomerLogic`, `Preferences`, `CustomerProfile` (`Data/Customers`), `CustomerAgent` | Customer lifecycle and preference tests; PlayMode service run |
| Dish score = recipe value × ingredient quality × freshness × minigame score, driving payment, tips and renown | `DishScoring`, `ServiceEconomy` (Shared), `ServiceSession.Settle` | 12 EditMode economy tests; full-loop ledger test |
| Tunable service length (default 6 min) and a results screen (dishes served, gold, tips, renown, walkouts) | `ServiceConfig`, `ServiceSession` clock, `TavernResultsScreen` | Clock and last-orders tests; PlayMode results test |
| One staff helper auto-resolves a station through `IMinigame` at reduced quality | `StaffDefinition` (Pip), `StaffCook`, `StaffAgent`, per-minigame auto-players | Auto-player tests (below expert, above zero); staff-cook test; PlayMode staff-only service |
| Tuning in ScriptableObjects, text localized, core logic tested | `Data/Tavern/*`, `Data/Config/EconomyConfig`, `TavernLocKeys` | Batch EditMode + PlayMode runs; file-name guard test |
| **Also asked for:** sold-out dishes marked on the HUD; new customers order something else or leave with a smaller penalty than a walkout | `ServiceSession` (per-order ingredient reservation, sold-out tracking), `TavernHud` | 6 EditMode sold-out/cancellation tests; PlayMode HUD test |

### Phase 1 criteria (unchanged)

| Criterion | Where |
|---|---|
| Movement (coyote time, jump buffer, dodge i-frames, wall slide/jump, drop-through) | `PlatformerMotor`, `KinematicMover2D`, `PlayerController` |
| Butcher's Cleaver 3-hit combo with hit-stop and screen shake | `ComboLogic`, `WeaponDefinition`, `HitStopDriver`, `ScreenShaker` |
| Three enemies with telegraphed attacks | `RatBehaviour`, `SlimeBehaviour`, `ShroomBehaviour` |
| Harvest drops (clean kill / overkill / element → quality) | `HarvestRules`, `HarvestSystem`, `IngredientPickup` |
| Essence meter and forced exit at zero | `EssenceMeter`, `PlayerVitals`, `DelveRunController` |
| Death screen, keeping one slot (the whole stack) | `DeathScreen`, `DeathPenalty`, `PersistentStash` |

## How a service works

1. **Prep screen:**
   - Fill the storeroom with the debug button or F4.
   - Pick up to 3 dishes. Each shows its station, gold value and how many servings your stock can make.
   - Put Pip on the Grill, Tap or Serving, or leave them off duty.
   - **Open the doors.**
2. **Customers arrive.**
   - They sit if a seat is free (6 seats); otherwise they queue by the door.
   - After reading the menu they order a dish that's still available, choosing by their tastes.
   - Placing an order **reserves** the ingredients, so it can't later become impossible to make.
   - The order appears on the rail on the right.
3. **Cooking:** walk to the Grill or Tap and press **E / A** to cook the next order for that station. The Grill and Tap panels show the minigame.
4. **Serving:** at the pass, press **E** to pick up the next dish. Walking it to the customer *is* the Serving minigame: customers walking across the floor bump you and spill the plate, and a full spill meter drops it.
5. **Eating and paying:** customers eat, pay the dish value, tip if they're happy, and change your renown.
   - **Walkout:** patience runs out. −3 renown, and uncooked reserved stock goes back to the storeroom.
   - **Sold out:** nothing they'd order can be made. −1 renown, and the HUD marks the dish "Sold out".
6. **Results:** the service ends after 6 minutes (no new arrivals in the last 45 s). "Prepare another evening" restarts the scene with an empty storeroom.

## Regenerating and verifying

- **Menus:** *Hearthdelve → Generate → Phase 1 (All)* and *Phase 2 Tavern (All)*.
  - They create missing scenes but **never overwrite an existing scene without asking** (CLAUDE.md).
  - Data assets are only ever created, so your tuning is kept. Prefabs are rebuilt every run.
- **Command line** (close the editor first):

```
"C:\Program Files\Unity\Hub\Editor\6000.3.19f1\Editor\Unity.exe" -batchmode -nographics -projectPath . -executeMethod Hearthdelve.Editor.Phase2Generator.RunBatch -logFile BatchLogs/generate2.log
"C:\Program Files\Unity\Hub\Editor\6000.3.19f1\Editor\Unity.exe" -batchmode -nographics -projectPath . -runTests -testPlatform EditMode -testResults BatchLogs/editmode.xml -logFile BatchLogs/editmode.log

```

## Needs you in the editor

1. **Play a service:** open `Assets/_Project/Scenes/TavernGreybox.unity` with a 16:9 Game view (1920×1080 works well) and press Play.
2. **Tuning.** Changes made in Play mode are kept after you exit.

   | Asset | What's in it | When changes apply |
   |---|---|---|
   | `Data/Tavern/ServiceConfig` | Length, arrival gaps, walk speed | Next evening |
   | `Data/Tavern/GrillConfig`, `TapConfig`, `ServingConfig` | Timing windows, staff error ranges; each notes the 5–10 s target | Next minigame |
   | `Data/Config/EconomyConfig` | Quality/freshness multipliers, tips, renown, flavor weights | Next dish |
   | `Data/Customers/*` | Patience, tastes, generosity | Next customer |
   | `Data/Staff/Staff_Pip` | Skill, quality cap | Next evening |
   | `Data/Recipes/*` | Ingredients, values | Next evening |

3. **Nothing needs manual wiring.**

## Known issues / limitations

**Tavern (Phase 2):**
- **No human playtest yet.** Patience, arrival rate, prices and minigame windows are first-pass numbers, and the UI layout hasn't been checked on screen.
- **No storeroom decay.** Freshness only comes from the debug fill; overnight decay is designed for but not implemented.
- **One staff helper.** The PlayMode test adds a second, test-only cook to run an end-to-end service with no player input.
- **Flat floor.** Customers walk along the floor only and walk through each other; the only collision that matters is plate bumps.
- **Restart empties the storeroom.** "Prepare another evening" reloads the scene, and nothing persists between evenings until the Phase 3 save and loop.
- **Minigame hints:** the Tap prompt names the Aim binding generically (e.g. "W/S"). Proper button icons will come with real UI art.

**Dungeon (Phase 1):**
- Air attacks stop horizontal drift.
- Enemies have no contact damage.
- The Shroom aims where you stood when its telegraph began.
- **Harvest feed text** is built by joining two localized strings; some languages may need one formatted string later.
- **Lockbox storage:** `PersistentStash` is in memory only until the Phase 3 save system.
- **Deferred** (not in the Phase 1 criteria): ledge grab, double jump, harvest finisher, extraction points, secondary weapon/skills, damage numbers, audio.

**General:**
- **UI scale:** the UI uses a 1280×720 reference resolution so the default font stays readable. Pixel-art UI at 640×360 will come with a proper pixel font.
- **Localization lookups** are synchronous (`WaitForCompletion`). That's fine on PC and consoles but wouldn't work on WebGL.
- **Standalone builds:** build the Localization Addressables content first (*Window → Asset Management → Addressables → Groups → Build → New Build → Default Build Script*). The editor doesn't need this.

## Decided

**Phase 2 (2026-09-29):**
1. **Freshness:**
   - Stored per stack, from 0 to 1; merged stacks take the count-weighted average.
   - Stock is used least-fresh first, then lower quality first.
   - Designed for later overnight storeroom decay with preservation upgrades (recorded in the GDD and CLAUDE.md).
2. **UI layering:** UI may read Tavern/Dungeon state; gameplay never references UI (CLAUDE.md).
3. **Sold out:**
   - Marked on the HUD.
   - New customers order something else, or leave with −1 renown (a walkout is −3).
   - Orders reserve their ingredients when placed.
4. **Minigame length:** 5–10 s each at default tuning, noted in each config and enforced by tests.
5. **Scenes:** never overwritten without approval. **Pushing:** at the end of each session.

**Phase 1:** whole-stack Lockbox; stack size 3; overkill tension with a clean-kill check mark; Inedible drops kept; uninterruptible Slime with its own tell.

## Open design questions

1. **Stronghold defense events:** still undecided. Not built; the Tavern floor is solid ground so combat could be added.
2. **Dropped plates:** a dropped plate currently re-queues the order if stock allows, costing the ingredients again; otherwise the customer leaves as sold out. Is that the right cost?
3. **Staff scope:** one helper covers one station. Should later staff cover multiple stations, or share one?
