# Hearthdelve — Progress

_Last updated: 2026-10-02 (4a final checks)_

## Phase 4 — Vertical slice, rebuilt top-down

### The pivot (2026-10-02)

Before Phase 4 the game changed from a side-scroller to a **top-down action roguelite with tavern management** (closer to Cult of the Lamb and Hades than to Dead Cells), rebuilt on a fresh Unity 6.6 project with third-party assets:

- **TopDown Engine 5.0** for the character controller, combat, AI, camera and rooms, with its bundled **MMFeedbacks** for game feel.
- **Nice Vibrations** (from Feel) for haptics.
- **Super Text Mesh** with uGUI for all UI and text, replacing UI Toolkit.
- **Minifantasy** (8×8, top-down) for all art.

The core loop, Harvest system, Essence, ingredients, recipes, tavern minigames, economy and story are unchanged. Design details are in `docs/GDD.md` (v0.2); working rules are in `CLAUDE.md`.

- The side-scroller prototype (Phases 1–3) is preserved at the tag **`v0-sidescroller-prototype`** and checked out read-only at `C:\Dev\Hearthdelve-v0`.
- The pivot is on the branch **`pivot/top-down`**. It merges to `main` only after the 4a look test is approved.
- Everything below the "Phase 1–3 history" heading describes the prototype at that tag, not the current project.

### Sub-milestones

Each is planned, approved, built and playtested separately. The web build must work at the end of each.

| | Sub-milestone | Contents |
|---|---|---|
| **4a** | Integration and look test | Project swap, port manifest, logic and tests ported, Nice Vibrations, Minifantasy import pipeline. One dungeon room and one tavern corner with real art at 320×180: TDE player with Essence, dodge and a melee combo; one enemy; one harvest drop; one combined hit feedback (visual + sound + haptic); one STM speech bubble; Y-sorting. `docs/ASSET_MAP.md`. |
| 4b | Dungeon migration | Phase 1 and 3 dungeon gameplay rebuilt on TDE (combat, harvest, Essence, death and Lockbox, extraction), with the dungeon haptics. |
| 4c | Tavern and UI migration | Top-down tavern, customers pathing to tables, 2D serving, Grill/Tap/Serving with their haptics, all UI rebuilt in uGUI + STM. |
| 4d | Biome 1 runs | Room-by-room structure, room rewards, run power-ups, 3 floors plus a boss arena. |
| 4e | Combat depth and boss | Harvest Finisher, Kitchen Arts, 3–4 more weapons with rarity and affixes, Essence Tonics, field cooking, Delve Marks and the Delver's Board, one relic, the Biome 1 boss. |
| 4f | Tavern Stage 1 content | Butcher Block minigame, all Biome 1 recipes, customer requests, Pip and Gundra, furniture and decor placement. |
| 4g | Story and character creation | Yarn Spinner with an STM dialogue presenter, the Act I opening, onboarding. |
| 4h | Menus, options and polish | Settings (screen shake, flash and vibration intensity), accessibility per GDD 12, audio system, web build. |

### 4a status

**Done:**

- **Project swap.** The repo now holds the Unity 6000.6.4f1 project; history is preserved. Vendor demo and sample folders were removed before the first commit (Assets 488 MB → 92 MB, 69 MB in Git LFS). The list is in `docs/THIRD_PARTY.md`.
- **Vendors compile cleanly** in batch mode: TopDown Engine 5.0, Super Text Mesh (with two assembly definitions we added), Nice Vibrations 4.1.2. Only one copy of MMFeedbacks/MMTools exists, and TDE's haptic feedbacks compile against Nice Vibrations.
- **Port manifest** written: `docs/PORT_MANIFEST.md` (94 Keep, 72 Adapt, 105 Drop).
- **Pure logic and EditMode tests ported:** 209 ported EditMode tests pass in batch mode with 0 compiler errors and 0 warnings in our code. Retired with the code they covered: 24 platformer-motor tests and 4 hit-stop tests.
- **New pure logic with tests** (34 tests), all in `Hearthdelve.Core`:
  - `GridMap` / `GridPathfinder`: 8-direction A* that never cuts corners.
  - `FacingLogic`: 8-direction input → the four drawn facings.
  - `HapticMath` / `HapticRamp`: settings scaling, gameplay value → rumble strength, layering, low-Essence heartbeat timing.
  - `GameSettings` gained vibration on/off, intensity and the reduced-intensity option.
- Docs: `CLAUDE.md` updated, GDD rewritten as v0.2, `docs/THIRD_PARTY.md` and `docs/CREDITS.md` added.

- **Project setup** (*Hearthdelve → Setup → Configure Project Settings*): no gravity; custom transparency sort axis (0, 1, 0) on the 2D renderer and in Graphics settings; a `Pickup` layer beside TDE's layers (which keep TDE's indices); the Nice Vibrations define on Standalone and Web; stale demo scenes removed from the build list.
- **Input:** `HearthdelveInputManager`, a subclass of TDE's `InputSystemManager`, maps our Dungeon or Tavern action map onto TDE's movement and buttons. The Dungeon map was rebuilt for top-down (no jump; adds `AimPoint` and `Heavy`). Aim follows the mouse on keyboard and mouse and the movement direction on a gamepad (`AimControlSwitcher`).
- **Minifantasy import pipeline:** `MinifantasySheets` lists every imported image and how it is sliced; *Hearthdelve → Art → Import Minifantasy* copies them from `C:\Dev\Minifantasy` and a postprocessor applies 8 PPU, point filtering, no compression and the slicing. 32 sheets from six packs are in (about 0.9 MB). `docs/ASSET_MAP.md` records what each sheet contains.
- **Haptics:** `HapticPattern` assets for the whole starting vocabulary (15 patterns, `Data/Haptics`), a pure `HapticMixer` (one-shots, continuous channels, settings), and `HapticService`, which sends the result to the gamepad through Nice Vibrations. `MMF_HapticPattern` plays a pattern from an `MMF_Player`. With no controller, and always on the web, it does nothing.
- **TDE boundary:** `TdeEventBridge` republishes TDE damage, death, revive and level-start events on our `EventBus` (`CharacterDamaged`, `CharacterDied`, `CharacterRevived`, `LevelStarted`). Nothing else of ours listens to `MMEventManager`.
- **Essence:** `EssenceHealth`, a subclass of TDE's `Health` backed by `EssenceMeter`. It is the player's only health pool: it drains over time, drops when TDE applies damage, and at zero the character dies through TDE's death path and `PlayerDefeated` is published once.
- **Tuning stays in assets:** `PlayerTuning` applies `PlayerMoveConfig` (walk speed, dodge distance, duration, cooldown, i-frames) to the TDE abilities; `ComboWeaponTuning` applies the cleaver's `WeaponDefinition` to the TDE combo weapon; `EnemyIdentity` applies `EnemyDefinition`.
- **Sprite animation:** `SpriteAnimationSet` assets generated from the Minifantasy sheets and their frame-duration guides, shown by `CharacterSpriteAnimator` (four drawn facings, state taken from the TDE character). Approved as the animation path instead of Mecanim, presentation only (CLAUDE.md, GDD §10.1).
- **Harvest:** `HarvestSystem` turns an enemy's death into drops through the existing `HarvestRules`; `IngredientPickup` puts them in the satchel (`SatchelCarrier`).
- **Localization on the web:** `Loc.Preload` loads the string tables without blocking; `LocalizationBoot` runs it in every scene and `LocalizedSuperText` refreshes when the tables arrive. On the web a lookup never waits synchronously.
- **The look test** (*Hearthdelve → Generate → 4a Look Test (All)*): `LookTest_Dungeon` and `LookTest_Tavern`, with real Minifantasy art.
  - Dungeon room: a 22×11-tile room from the Dungeon tileset with props and torches; the player (Human Townsfolk) with Essence, a dodge roll with i-frames and the three-hit cleaver combo; two Green Slimes that chase and deal contact damage; a harvest drop to pick up; one combined hit feedback (flash, screen shake, placeholder sound and the `Tap.Firm` haptic in a single `MMF_Player`); props that sort by Y.
  - Tavern corner: the premade room from the Tavern Indoor add-on; the same TDE character without weapon or Essence; a cook behind the bar with a Super Text Mesh speech bubble that appears when the player is near.
  - **F2** cycles the reference resolution (320×180, 240×135, 160×90) so character scale can be compared live. **F3** switches between the two scenes.

Tests, all passing in batch mode with 0 compiler warnings in our code:

- **293 project EditMode tests** (the run reports 294; a package adds one stub test). 50 are new in 4a, including the pixel stepping rule and VSync: haptic envelope and mixer, the haptic library asset, sprite timing, Minifantasy import settings, `IngredientItem` identity, and the render pipeline setup.
- **21 PlayMode tests** against the two look-test scenes: the top-down setup, the camera follow keeping the player on one screen pixel and stepping diagonals cleanly while walking diagonally and dodging (both scenes), the speech bubble staying locked to its speaker, lit sprites and representative lighting in both scenes, Essence as the only health pool and its drain, keyboard movement, walls, the dodge roll and its i-frames, gameplay with every sprite animator switched off (the animator is presentation only), enemy contact damage with its feedback, the combo killing a slime that drops a harvest the player picks up, death at zero Essence (reported once), haptics respecting settings and doing nothing without a controller, the tavern character, the bar and both table sets blocking the player from below, furniture footprints ending at their sort point, the localized speech bubble, table preloading, and the resolution switch.

**Web smoke test (2026-10-02): passed.** A development web build (`Builds/Web`, 125 MB, 0 errors), served locally and played in Chrome:

- Both scenes render; the camera follows the player; walls and the bar block movement.
- The Localization tables load from the build's Addressables bundles, and every Super Text Mesh text shows its English string: the HUD labels, the controls hint, the resolution label and the cook's speech bubble.
- F2 changes the reference resolution and F3 switches scenes.
- A slime's contact damage plays the combined hit feedback (flash, shake, sound, haptic) with no errors; rumble does nothing on the web, as intended.
- Essence reaching zero kills the player and the room restarts.
- The browser console shows no errors from the game.

**Fixed after the first look-test review (2026-10-02):**

- **The room shook whenever the player moved** (both scenes, controller and keyboard alike; fine when standing still). Measured in PlayMode, frame by frame at 60 fps:
  - No impulse or MMFeedbacks shake fired during movement.
  - With the camera follow disabled the world was stable, so the fault was in the follow / pixel-perfect pipeline.
  - The Pixel Perfect Camera is the only system that snaps or sizes the camera, and its snapped position never stepped backwards.
  - The cause was the follow's 0.4 damping. The camera trailed the player by a fractional amount that changed every frame, so the player and the camera rounded to different art pixels on alternate frames. The player's on-screen position flickered by 1 px, 31–87 times in a 1.2 s walk (up to 8 px of range in the dungeon), and with the eye on the player the whole room appeared to shake.
  - The Brain's SmartUpdate was a second risk: on FixedUpdate timing the camera stalled on frames without a physics step.

  After the first fix, the room still shook slightly, much more on diagonals, and the tavern text shook. Three more causes, each measured:
  - **Diagonal zig-zag:** the Pixel Perfect Camera rounds X and Y independently. Unless a diagonal walk happened to start on whole pixels, the axes crossed pixel boundaries on different frames, so the room stepped sideways one frame and up the next. In the tavern, 40 of 58 camera steps moved one axis only. Now the player is drawn at a pixel-snapped display position that steps like a Bresenham line along the direction of movement: the slower axis steps on the faster axis's frames, and the lead axis only changes when the other is clearly faster (otherwise float noise at exactly 45 degrees flips it). The camera follows that drawn position. Result: 0 single-axis steps during steady diagonal movement in both scenes. This is presentation only (`PixelSnappedPresentation`, rule in `Core/Movement/PixelStepping` with EditMode tests); gameplay positions are untouched, and the drawn position stays within 1.25 px of the real one.
  - **Speech bubble:** it was placed from the unsnapped camera, possibly before Cinemachine had moved it, so it slid smoothly while the room under it moved in whole-pixel steps (it took 12 different positions against the cook in one short walk). It now updates after Cinemachine and places itself from the snapped camera in whole art pixels: one constant offset.
  - **Frame pacing:** the quality level used for Windows and the web ("Fantastic") had VSync off, so frames were uncapped and the pixel steps landed unevenly against the display. VSync is now on for every quality level (the web uses requestAnimationFrame).

  Fix: the Brain updates in LateUpdate and the follow has no damping. The player now stays on one screen pixel while walking diagonally and dodging, in both scenes. The scenes and player prefabs were updated in place (*Hearthdelve → Generate → Update Look Test Camera*), and `CameraFollowTests` guards it: the player stays on one screen pixel, the camera never steps on one axis during steady diagonal movement, and the bubble stays locked to the cook. Pixel Perfect Camera, 320×180 / 8 PPU and the lit baseline are unchanged. The camera no longer eases after the player; if softer camera motion is wanted later, it has to keep the player on a fixed screen pixel.

- **Clipping into the bar from below.** Not movement through a collider: the bar's collider ended at the counter, 6 px above the bottom of its art (its stool row), so a player stopped below the counter was already behind the bar's sort point and drew behind it. The table sets had the same gap (their collider covered only the table, not the chairs). Each furniture piece now carries its own collision, and every footprint ends exactly at the bottom of its art. This is the rule for all solid furniture and props (CLAUDE.md, Y-sorting). The existing tavern scene was updated in place (*Hearthdelve → Generate → Update Tavern Furniture Collision*), not rebuilt.
- **The project was not running URP.** Graphics Settings pointed at a render pipeline asset that doesn't exist: the 2026-10-02 project swap kept the old repo's `UniversalRP.asset.meta`, which gave the asset a different GUID. Unity fell back to the Built-in pipeline without any error, in the editor, the tests and every build. On the web this showed up as missing text: build-time shader stripping removed every URP-tagged shader, Super Text Mesh's included. `ProjectConfigurator` now assigns `Assets/Settings/UniversalRP.asset`, and an EditMode test guards it. The look did not change at that point, because the generated sprites still used the unlit default sprite material; they are lit now (see "Decided at the end of 4a").

**Before 4a sign-off:** your final visual check of the lit look test. Nothing in 4b starts, and nothing merges to `main`, until then.

### Checks made for the pivot

1. **Import:** TDE 5.0 and STM compile on Unity 6000.6.4f1 with 0 errors. STM gives 22 obsolete-API warnings (worth re-checking on 6.7). Package changes are listed in `docs/THIRD_PARTY.md`.
2. **Nice Vibrations on its own:** works. Only `Feel/NiceVibrations` was imported; there is no duplicate MMTools/MMFeedbacks.
3. **Rumble platforms:** off mobile, Nice Vibrations rumbles through the Input System (`Gamepad.SetMotorSpeeds`). Expected, **not yet tested on hardware**: Xbox controllers work; DualShock 4 and DualSense work over USB; Switch Pro has no rumble on PC unless Steam Input presents it as an Xbox pad; web builds have no rumble. Unsupported cases must do nothing, silently.
4. **Art:**
   - Sheets are 32×32 frames with an ~8×8 body, four rows for four **diagonal** facings (front-right, front-left, back-right, back-left); death is a single row.
   - Creatures, True Heroes and many exclusives have full idle/walk/attack/damage/die sets.
   - A Myriad of NPCs has layered outfits and hair only for idle, walk, damage and die, so it can't be a layered combat character. The Weapons pack layers weapons over a bare body for all attacks.
   - There is no rat with an attack, no sound of any kind, and no pixel font found yet.
5. **Pathfinding:** TDE's is NavMesh-based and 3D-only. We write our own grid A* in pure C#.

### Decided for the pivot (2026-10-02)

1. **Player customization:** a pre-clothed body with palette swaps (skin, hair, outfit colours), not layered outfits.
2. **Biome 1 roster:** the Giant Rat is replaced by the Bat and Giant Spider; the boss is the Mother Slime, replacing the Cellar King. Final mapping is reviewed in `docs/ASSET_MAP.md`.
3. **Super Text Mesh** gets two assembly definitions inside its folder (no code changes).
4. **Sound:** generated placeholders for now. Real SFX and music need a source later.
5. **GDD** converted from an HTML export to Markdown.
6. **Technical:** 320×180 at 8 PPU (to confirm in the look test), Unity 6.6 now and 6.7 LTS on release.

### Needs you in the editor (4a)

Done on 2026-10-02: Web Build Support installed; the look scenes, the camera scales and controller rumble tested and reported good.

- **Tuning** (changes made in Play mode apply immediately): `Data/Config/PlayerMoveConfig` (walk speed, dodge), `Data/Weapons/Weapon_ButchersCleaver` (combo damage, timing, reach), `Data/Config/EssenceConfig` (drain, post-hit invulnerability), `Data/Enemies/Enemy_GreenSlime`, and the patterns in `Data/Haptics`.

### Open design questions (4a)

1. **Protagonist body:** the Human Townsfolk is a stand-in. See `docs/ASSET_MAP.md`.

### Decided at the end of 4a (2026-10-02)

1. **Resolution locked:** 320×180 at 8 PPU (CLAUDE.md, GDD §8.1).
2. **URP 2D lit sprites are the visual baseline.** The look test uses URP's lit sprite material everywhere, with simple representative lighting: in the dungeon, a cool, dim ambient light and two warm torch lights; in the tavern, a warm ambient light and a warm glow over the bar. The existing scenes and prefabs were updated in place (*Hearthdelve → Generate → Update Look Test Lighting*). The values are in `LookTestBuilder` and on the scene lights, so they can be tweaked in the editor. This is not a lighting system yet.
3. **SpriteSet animation** instead of Mecanim, presentation only (CLAUDE.md, GDD §10.1).
4. **Frame pacing:** TDE's `GameManager` defaults to a 300 fps target, which makes a web build run its main loop on a timer instead of `requestAnimationFrame`. The look-test scenes use -1 (the platform default) instead.

### Known issues

- **Character size:** at 320×180 a character is about 4% of screen height. This is the main thing to judge in the look test.
- **The look-test UI is placeholder:** the Essence bar is a plain bar, and text uses Unity's built-in font through Super Text Mesh (no pixel font exists).
- **Look-test death:** at zero Essence the room restarts after 2.5 s. The real death screen and Lockbox flow are 4b.
- **Heavy / charged attack** is bound (`Dungeon/Heavy`) but not built; it is 4b with the rest of combat.
- **Slime behaviour** is chase and contact damage only. Telegraphed attacks from `AttackCycle` are 4b. TDE's move-towards action stops once the slime is lined up horizontally, so a slime can sit just above or below the player without touching (`UseMinimumXDistance`; fix with the 4b enemy work).
- **Enemies ignore obstacles** when chasing; the grid A* is not wired to a TDE AI action yet (4b).
- **No swap prompt:** a pickup that doesn't fit in the satchel stays on the floor (4b).
- **Vendor prefabs with missing references** after the demo trim are listed in `docs/THIRD_PARTY.md`; we don't use them.
- **Leftovers to remove in 4b:** `GamePause`'s hit-stop flag and the `HitStopRequested` event (hit-stop moves to MMFeedbacks).
- **Data assets** for enemies, ingredients and recipes still describe the old roster; only the slime's two parts have icons.

### Regenerating and verifying (current project)

- **Menu:** *Hearthdelve → Generate → 4a Look Test (All)*. It configures the project, imports the Minifantasy sheets, and builds the data assets, prefabs and the two scenes.
  - Scenes are created when missing and **never overwritten without asking** (a dialog in the editor; `-rebuildScene` in batch mode).
  - Data assets (configs, haptic patterns) are only created, so your tuning is kept. Animation sets, tiles and prefabs are rebuilt every run.
- **Command line** (close the editor first):

```
"C:\Program Files\Unity\Hub\Editor\6000.6.4f1\Editor\Unity.exe" -batchmode -nographics -projectPath . -executeMethod Hearthdelve.Editor.LookTestBuilder.RunBatch -logFile BatchLogs/generate.log
"C:\Program Files\Unity\Hub\Editor\6000.6.4f1\Editor\Unity.exe" -batchmode -nographics -projectPath . -runTests -testPlatform EditMode -testResults BatchLogs/editmode.xml -logFile BatchLogs/editmode.log
"C:\Program Files\Unity\Hub\Editor\6000.6.4f1\Editor\Unity.exe" -batchmode -projectPath . -runTests -testPlatform PlayMode -testResults BatchLogs/playmode.xml -logFile BatchLogs/playmode.log

"C:\Program Files\Unity\Hub\Editor\6000.6.4f1\Editor\Unity.exe" -batchmode -projectPath . -executeMethod Hearthdelve.Editor.BuildTools.BuildWebBatch -logFile BatchLogs/webbuild.log
```

The capture command renders each look-test scene at 320×180 into `BatchLogs/looktest_*.png`. The web build needs the Web build module.

# Phase 1–3 history (side-scroller prototype, tag `v0-sidescroller-prototype`)

## Status

- **Phase 1 (Combat Prototype):** done and playtested by you in the editor. Feel tuning is ongoing.
- **Phase 2 (Tavern Prototype):** implemented and playtested once (2026-09-29). Feedback applied:
  - **Round 1:** hand delivery with a button, spare plates, final sold-out, and closing early when everything sells out.
  - **Round 2:** a 2.5-minute service, Pip on Serving by default, and a Stew Pot station with a chopping minigame (beyond the GDD's Phase 2 scope, approved).
  - Chopping and the stew pot were playtested by you and work.
- **Phase 3 (Loop Prototype):** implemented and passing automated verification. **Not yet playtested.** Balance numbers are first-pass.

Tests: **237 project EditMode tests + 21 PlayMode tests, all passing, 0 compiler warnings.** The batch run reports one more EditMode test because the Addressables package adds a stub test.

## How a day works

1. **Start:** open `Assets/_Project/Scenes/Boot.unity` (or `MainMenu`, which opens Boot) and press Play.
   - **New Game** starts Day 1 with an empty storeroom and no gold.
   - **Continue** loads the one save slot and resumes where it was saved (Night, or Morning after you slept).
2. **Morning (tavern):**
   - The storeroom and today's delve bonuses are shown.
   - **Breakfast (optional, one dish):** pick a Grill or Tap dish the storeroom can make, then play its minigame. It uses one serving's ingredients.
     - Grill dishes add max Essence; Tap drinks slow Essence drain.
     - The dish's quality scales the buff. Stews aren't offered.
     - Esc puts the ingredients back.
   - **Descend into the dungeon.**
3. **Delve (dungeon):**
   - Satchel slots and max Essence include your upgrades and breakfast.
   - Carried parts lose freshness over time; the bar under each satchel slot shows it.
   - **The exit** is the door on the raised block at the far right end. Stand at it and press **E** to go home with the whole satchel.
   - If Essence runs out, pick one Lockbox slot on the death screen. Only that stack goes home, and the day still continues to Evening.
4. **Evening (tavern):**
   - The usual prep screen and service, cooking from the storeroom.
   - If nothing can be cooked (or you'd rather not open), **Close for the night** goes straight to Night.
   - On the results screen, **Close up for the night** banks the takings (payments + tips).
5. **Night (tavern):**
   - Gold and renown, and the three **upgrades**, each with a few levels at rising cost.
   - The **debug day summary** (F10): parts brought back and lost, dishes sold, gold and tips earned, and the cheapest next upgrade.
   - The game **autosaves** when Night starts and after each purchase.
   - **Sleep:** storeroom stock loses a little freshness overnight, then it's the next Morning (and another autosave).

When `TavernGreybox` or `CombatGreybox` is played on its own (no Boot), it behaves as before: a single evening with the debug fill, or a dungeon run that restarts.

## How a service works

1. **Prep screen:**
   - Fill the storeroom with the debug button or F4.
   - Pick up to 3 dishes. Each shows its station, gold value and how many servings your stock can make. For a stew it shows how many pots, and the helpings range per pot.
   - Pip starts on **Serving**. You can move them to the Grill, Tap or Stew Pot, or take them off duty.
   - **Open the doors.**
2. **Customers arrive.**
   - They sit if a seat is free (6 seats); otherwise they queue by the door.
   - After reading the menu they order a dish that's still available, choosing by their tastes.
   - Placing an order **reserves** the ingredients, so it can't later become impossible to make. Stews are the exception: ingredients are taken per batch when the pot goes on.
   - The order appears on the rail on the right.
3. **Cooking:** walk to the Grill or Tap and press **E / A** to cook the next order for that station. The Grill and Tap panels show the minigame.
   - **Stew Pot** (right-hand wall):
     - While the pot is empty and a stew on the menu can be made, press **E** to put a batch on. It takes one full set of the recipe's ingredients and makes the stew with the most orders waiting.
     - **Chop** each ingredient. Move the knife with the mouse (or the stick / A–D) and click (or Space / A) on each guide line. Each cut counts for the nearest uncut line and scores by how close it lands.
     - Each ingredient has a time limit (the bar under the board). Esc steps away and returns the ingredients.
     - Chop accuracy sets the helpings: 3 (sloppy) to 5 (clean). The quality of a stew comes from its ingredients, freshness and serving.
     - The pot then **simmers on its own** for 25 s, with a bar above it. Pips above the pot show the helpings: dim while simmering, bright when ready.
     - Stew orders show "Waiting on the pot" on the rail. Each is **ladled onto the pass automatically** when a helping is ready, for you or Pip to carry. The pot empties when the last helping goes.
     - A stew stays on the menu while the helpings in the pot, plus 3 per batch the storeroom can still make, cover the orders waiting.
4. **Serving:** at the pass, press **E** to pick up the next dish. Carrying it *is* the Serving minigame: customers walking across the floor bump you and spill the plate, and a full spill meter drops it.
   - Press **E** next to a seated customer who ordered that dish to serve it. It doesn't have to be the customer it was cooked for. The customer who would receive the plate gets a gold ring on the floor, like a station in reach.
   - If you give A's plate to B, B's order passes to A.
   - Next to someone who ordered something else, the hint shows what they ordered.
   - Press **E** at the pass to put the plate back.
   - The score compares your time with the straight-line trip from the pass, so wandering costs quality.
5. **Spare plates:** if a customer leaves after their dish started cooking, the dish isn't wasted. It becomes a *spare* (italic on the order rail, "Spare" once it's on the pass).
   - You can serve it to anyone waiting for that dish. Their own order is then cancelled and its ingredients go back to the storeroom.
   - A new customer who orders that dish gets the spare automatically, without using more stock.
   - Pip, when serving, only carries plates someone is waiting for. If that customer leaves or you serve them first, Pip takes the plate back to the pass.
6. **Eating and paying:** customers eat, pay the dish value, tip if they're happy, and change your renown.
   - **Walkout:** patience runs out. −3 renown, and uncooked reserved stock goes back to the storeroom.
   - **Sold out:** once the stock can't make a dish, it's marked "Sold out" and **stays off the menu for the rest of the night**, even if a walkout returns ingredients (they stay in the storeroom).
   - A customer who finds nothing left to order leaves with −1 renown.
7. **Closing:**
   - The service ends after 2.5 minutes (no new arrivals in the last 20 s).
   - **Everything sold out:** the door closes to new customers. Orders already placed can still be cooked and served. Service ends early once nobody is waiting for food and every diner has paid, and the results screen says you closed early.
   - Diners still eating at closing time pay for their meal.
   - Played on its own, "Prepare another evening" restarts the scene with an empty storeroom. In the day loop the button is "Close up for the night".
   - **Open the doors** needs at least one menu dish the storeroom can make.
   - **Seats:** 6 to start. The room has 8 stools, and the extra ones appear as seat upgrades are bought.

## Regenerating and verifying

- **Menus:** *Hearthdelve → Generate → Phase 3 Loop (All)*. This runs Phases 1 and 2 as well, and builds Boot and MainMenu. *Phase 1 (All)* and *Phase 2 Tavern (All)* still work on their own.
  - They create missing scenes but **never overwrite an existing scene without asking** (CLAUDE.md).
  - Data assets are only ever created, so your tuning is kept. Prefabs are rebuilt every run.
- **Command line** (close the editor first):

```
"C:\Program Files\Unity\Hub\Editor\6000.3.19f1\Editor\Unity.exe" -batchmode -nographics -projectPath . -executeMethod Hearthdelve.Editor.Phase3Generator.RunBatch -logFile BatchLogs/generate3.log
"C:\Program Files\Unity\Hub\Editor\6000.3.19f1\Editor\Unity.exe" -batchmode -nographics -projectPath . -runTests -testPlatform EditMode -testResults BatchLogs/editmode.xml -logFile BatchLogs/editmode.log
"C:\Program Files\Unity\Hub\Editor\6000.3.19f1\Editor\Unity.exe" -batchmode -nographics -projectPath . -runTests -testPlatform PlayMode -testResults BatchLogs/playmode.xml -logFile BatchLogs/playmode.log
```

## Needs you in the editor

1. **Play the loop:** open `Assets/_Project/Scenes/Boot.unity` with a 16:9 Game view (1920×1080 works well) and press Play. Use the Night summary (F10) to judge whether a day funds about one upgrade.
   - Saves go to `Application.persistentDataPath` (`%USERPROFILE%\AppData\LocalLow\sagaphy\Hearthdelve\save_slot_1.json`). Delete that file for a clean start.
   - To test service alone, `TavernGreybox` still plays on its own.
2. **Tuning.** Changes made in Play mode are kept after you exit.

   | Asset | What's in it | When changes apply |
   |---|---|---|
   | `Data/Tavern/ServiceConfig` | Length, arrival gaps, walk speed | Next evening |
   | `Data/Tavern/GrillConfig`, `TapConfig`, `ServingConfig` | Timing windows, staff error ranges; each notes the 5–10 s target | Next minigame |
   | `Data/Tavern/StewConfig` | Chop: lines per ingredient, accuracy window, time limit, knife speed, board position on screen. Pot: simmer time, helpings range | Next batch |
   | `Data/Config/EconomyConfig` | Quality/freshness multipliers, tips, renown, flavor weights | Next dish |
   | `Data/Customers/*` | Patience, tastes, generosity | Next customer |
   | `Data/Staff/Staff_Pip` | Skill, quality cap | Next evening |
   | `Data/Recipes/*` | Ingredients, values, breakfast buff (kind + amount) | Next evening / next breakfast |
   | `Data/Upgrades/*` | Levels: cost and amount per level | Next purchase (effects apply next delve / evening) |
   | `Data/Config/FreshnessConfig` | Dungeon loss per minute, overnight loss, Chilled multiplier | Next delve / next night |
   | `Data/GameDatabase` | New-game gold, `allowDebugFill`, the ingredient and upgrade lists saves look up | Next new game / immediately |
   | `Data/Tavern/TavernContent` | `baseSeats` (before upgrades) | Next evening |

3. **Nothing needs manual wiring.**

## Known issues / limitations

**Day loop (Phase 3):**
- **Not playtested yet.**
  - **Upgrade costs:** 100/180/280 satchel, 80/150/240 Essence, 120/220 seats.
  - **Breakfast buffs:** +15–25 max Essence (Grill), 20–30% slower drain (Tap).
  - **Freshness:** 0.08 lost per dungeon minute and per night.
  - All of these are estimates; the Night summary is there to check them.
- **The same dungeon every day.** It's the one greybox level with fixed enemies, so the haul is similar each day. Procedural rooms are out of scope.
- **No spoilage.** Parts at 0 freshness are still usable, just worth less.
- **No staff wages or upkeep yet** (GDD §7.3).
- **Quitting mid-day** loses progress back to the last save (Night or Morning), by design (GDD §10.6).
- **Breakfast in `TavernGreybox` played on its own** isn't available; Morning only exists in the day loop.

**Tavern (Phase 2):**
- **Chopping and the stew pot:** playtested and working; simmer time, helpings and stew prices are still first-pass numbers.
- **Pip on the Stew Pot** keeps a batch going whenever the pot is empty, which can use up ingredients the Grill dishes need.
- **Stew orders aren't reserved.** A Grill dish can use up ingredients a waiting stew order was counting on. That order then waits until it walks out.
- **Leftover helpings** in the pot at closing are discarded.
- **One playtest so far.** Patience, arrival rate, prices and minigame windows are still first-pass numbers.
- **Delivery reach** reuses `ServiceConfig → player → interactRange` (0.9 tiles). The nearest matching customer in reach is served and gets the gold floor ring (a placeholder until real art brings a sprite outline).
- **Spare plates left at closing** are simply discarded.
- **One staff helper.** The PlayMode test adds a second, test-only cook to run an end-to-end service with no player input.
- **Flat floor.** Customers walk along the floor only and walk through each other; the only collision that matters is plate bumps.
- **Minigame hints:** the Tap prompt names the Aim binding generically (e.g. "W/S"). Proper button icons will come with real UI art.

**Dungeon (Phase 1):**
- Air attacks stop horizontal drift.
- Enemies have no contact damage.
- The Shroom aims where you stood when its telegraph began.
- **Harvest feed text** is built by joining two localized strings; some languages may need one formatted string later.
- **Deferred:** ledge grab, double jump, harvest finisher, secondary weapon/skills, damage numbers, audio. (One extraction point now exists, at the end of the level.)

**General:**
- **UI scale:** the UI uses a 1280×720 reference resolution so the default font stays readable. Pixel-art UI at 640×360 will come with a proper pixel font.
- **Localization lookups** are synchronous (`WaitForCompletion`). That's fine on PC and consoles but wouldn't work on WebGL.
- **Standalone builds:** build the Localization Addressables content first (*Window → Asset Management → Addressables → Groups → Build → New Build → Default Build Script*). The editor doesn't need this.

## Decided

**Phase 3 (2026-09-29):**
1. **Where the loop lives:** `GameFlow` and the day logic are in `Hearthdelve.Shared`. The Boot scene stays loaded, and content scenes load additively. Played on their own, the Tavern and Combat scenes work as before.
2. **Breakfast:**
   - Each recipe has its own buff: Grill → max Essence, Tap → slower drain.
   - Dish quality scales it, up to ×1.25.
   - Grill and Tap dishes only; no stews.
3. **Upgrades:** levels with rising cost, defined in the upgrade assets.
4. **Saves:** v2 JSON with content saved by id; v1 is migrated. Autosave at Night (and after purchases, and after sleeping). Continue resumes at the saved phase.
5. **Scenes:** CombatGreybox and TavernGreybox rebuilt (approved); Boot and MainMenu added; Boot is first in the build list.

**Phase 2 playtest feedback, round 2 (2026-09-29):**
1. **Service length:** 2.5 minutes, with last orders 20 s before the end.
2. **Pip defaults to Serving.**
3. **Chopping and the Stew Pot:**
   - Mouse or stick moves the knife.
   - Chop accuracy sets the helpings (not quality).
   - Stew orders are ladled onto the pass automatically.

**Phase 2 playtest feedback (2026-09-29):**
1. **Hand delivery:** a button serves a plate. Any waiting customer who ordered the same dish can take it; their order passes to the plate's original customer, or is cancelled with its stock returned if that customer has gone.
2. **Sold out is final** for the night.
3. **When everything sells out:** the door closes, open orders finish, and service ends early once the last diner has paid.

**Phase 2 (2026-09-29):**
1. **Freshness:**
   - Stored per stack, from 0 to 1; merged stacks take the count-weighted average.
   - Stock is used least-fresh first, then lower quality first.
   - Designed for later overnight storeroom decay with preservation upgrades (recorded in the GDD and CLAUDE.md).
2. **UI layering:** UI may read Tavern/Dungeon state; gameplay never references UI (CLAUDE.md).
3. **Sold out:**
   - Marked on the HUD.
   - New customers order something else, or leave with −1 renown (a walkout is −3).
   - Orders reserve their ingredients when placed.
4. **Minigame length:** 5–10 s each at default tuning, noted in each config and enforced by tests.
5. **Scenes:** never overwritten without approval. **Pushing:** at the end of each session.

**Phase 1:** whole-stack Lockbox; stack size 3; overkill tension with a clean-kill check mark; Inedible drops kept; uninterruptible Slime with its own tell.

## Open design questions

1. **Stronghold defense events:** still undecided. Not built; the Tavern floor is solid ground so combat could be added.
2. **Dropped plates:** a dropped plate currently re-queues the order if stock allows, costing the ingredients again; otherwise the customer leaves as sold out. (A dropped spare is just gone.) Is that the right cost?
3. **Staff scope:** one helper covers one station. Should later staff cover multiple stations, or share one?
